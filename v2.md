# Instagram Bot
A Python class for interacting with the Instagram API.

# Method Summary

The `__init__ method` is the constructor for the `InstagramBot class`, and it is called when a new `InstagramBot object` is created.
This method takes an `api_key` argument and assigns it to the `api_key attribute` of the `InstagramBot object`.
It also initializes several other attributes that will be used to store data such as the **access token**, **user ID**, and **session ID**.

The `login method` allows the user to log in to their Instagram account by providing their `username` and `password`.
It does this by making a `POST request` to the `https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/ajax/` endpoint with the **username** and **password** as parameters.
If the login is successful, the method stores the **user ID**, **session ID**, and **CSRF token** in the InstagramBot object's attributes.

The `authenticate method` is similar to the login method, but it also retrieves an `access token` that can be used to access the Instagram API.
It makes a `POST request` to the `https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/ajax/` endpoint with the **username**, **password**, and **api_key** as parameters, and stores the **access token**, **user ID**, **CSRF token**, and **session ID** in the InstagramBot object's attributes if the authentication is successful.

The `follow method` allows the user to follow a specific Instagram user by providing the user's **username**.
It retrieves the user's ID by calling the get_user_id method and then makes a `POST request` to the `https://www.instagram.com/web/friendships/{user_id}/follow/` endpoint with the user ID and the CSRF token as parameters. If the request is successful, it prints a message indicating that the user was followed.

The `unfollow method` is similar to the follow method, but it allows the user to unfollow a specific Instagram user by making a `POST request` to the `https://www.instagram.com/web/friendships/{user_id}/unfollow/` endpoint with the user ID and the CSRF token as parameters.
If the request is successful, it prints a message indicating that the user was unfollowed.

The `get_user_id method` retrieves the user ID for a specific Instagram user by making a `GET request` to the `https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/search` endpoint with the username and api_key as parameters.
It returns the user ID if it is found.

The `get_media_items method` retrieves a list of media items (e.g., photos and videos) for a specific Instagram user by making a `GET request` to the `https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/{user_id}/media/recent` endpoint with the user ID and api_key as parameters.
It prints out information about each media item, such as its ID and type.

The `like method` allows the user to like a specific media item by providing its media_item_id. It makes a `POST request` to the `https://www.instagram.com/web/likes/{media_item_id}/like/` endpoint with the media item ID and the CSRF token as parameters.
If the request is successful, it prints a message indicating that the media item was liked.

The `unlike method` is similar to the like method, but it allows the user to unlike a specific media item by making a `POST request` to the `https://www.instagram.com/web/likes/{media_item_id}/unlike/` endpoint with the media item ID and the CSRF token as parameters. 
If the request is successful, it prints a message indicating that the media item was unliked.
